        My final project's theme is based on the 2000 Hong Kong film 花樣年華, or its English title <i>In The Mood for Love</i> , by Wong Kar-Wai. It is personally one of my favorite films especially due to its cinematography, music, and aesthetic. The film itself is themed around Hong Kong nostalgia. The film has an overlay of red and green colors, which also acts as its main color palette which I think is beautiful and conveys the feeling of melancholy. Through this project I want to be able to showcase the aesthetics of this film the best I can, simply to appreciate it and hopefully convey my enthusiasm for it.</p>
